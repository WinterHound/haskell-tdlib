## FAQ

* Q: Why there are .hs-boot files? \
A: Because of [recursive imports](https://wiki.haskell.org/Mutually_recursive_modules). 

* Q: Why Int decoding so strange? \
A: Int64 are sent as [strings](https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/179) and others are not.

* Q: Why you did X instead of Y? \
A: I'm new to Haskell, most likely I donâ€™t know about it yet.

* Q: Why there are underlines in some record fields? \
A: Some record fields have different types in the same data type.

Let me know if there is an easier way to make something.
