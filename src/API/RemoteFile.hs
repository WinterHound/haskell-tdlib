-- Represents a remote file
-- 
-- __id__ Remote file identifier; may be empty. Can be used across application restarts or even from other devices for the current user. Uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have a lot of different valid identifiers.
-- 
-- -If the ID starts with "http://" or "https://", it represents the HTTP URL of the file. TDLib is currently unable to download files if only their URL is known.
-- 
-- -If downloadFile is called on such a file or if it is sent to a secret chat, TDLib starts a file generation process by sending updateFileGenerationStart to the client with the HTTP URL in the original_path and "#url#" as the conversion string. Clients should generate the file by downloading it to the specified location
-- 
-- __unique_id__ Unique file identifier; may be empty if unknown. The unique file identifier which is the same for the same file even for different users and is persistent over time
-- 
-- __is_uploading_active__ True, if the file is currently being uploaded (or a remote copy is being generated by some other means)
-- 
-- __is_uploading_completed__ True, if a remote copy is fully available
-- 
-- __uploaded_size__ Size of the remote available part of the file; 0 if unknown
